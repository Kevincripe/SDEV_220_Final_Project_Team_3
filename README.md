## Getting Started with the Boost Auto LLC Django Project

This README outlines the steps to set up and run the project effectively.

**Prerequisites:**

- **Python 3.x:** Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. You can verify by running `python --version` in your terminal. If you need to install Python, download it from [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **Virtual Environment (Recommended):** Create a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies. Use tools like `venv` (built-in) or `virtualenv` for this purpose:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv  # Using venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # Activate the virtual environment
   ```

**Project Setup:**

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   Use Git to clone the project from GitHub:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kevincripe/SDEV_220_Final_Project_Team_3.git

   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   Install the required packages using `pip`:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

**Running the Django Application:**

1. **Start the Development Server:**
   Run the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

   This will start the Django development server, typically running on http://127.0.0.1:8000/. Open your web browser and access the application at this address.

**Additional Notes:**

- **Documentation:** The project's code should be well-commented to enhance understanding and maintainability.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully set up and run the Boost Auto LLC Django project.
